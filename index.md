## How to get Bowen (or any other radio broadcaster) synced to your TV

**The following is for PC/Windows machines**

For Mac, you can use <a href="http://www.silentway.com/forum/how-sync-radio-tv-simulcast-simple-free-method" target="new">this method</a>. I haven't tested, but thought I'd include it anyways as a fellow Mac user. 

Apologies Linux users, I don't have a method for you, but if you're using Linux, something tells me you're more than capable of finding a way ;)

### REQUIREMENTS:

**Audio:**

1) A tablet, phone, computer, receiver, or any other device with an output (headphone jack, aux/line out etc.) where you can dial in SN590 or TSN1050 feed of Bowen's call

2) An audio cable*

	* Depending on your device you may need an audio cable to connect it to your computer, so either a 3.5mm cable (for headphone/aux/line outputs), a TosLink, HMDI etc. If you're using the same computer to delay the radio feed and play the audio, you don't need a cable.

**Apps:**

1) Radio Delay: <a href="http://www.daansystems.com/radiodelay/" target="new">daansystems.com/radiodelay/</a>

2 Virtual Audio Cable* if you plan on using your computer to get the radio broadcast: <a href="https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/" target="new">vb-audio.com/Cable/</a>

	* You DON'T need this if you're using an external audio device 

### SETUP:


**Part One:**

1) If you're using an external device, connect your audio device to your PC via headphone jack or line/aux out to "line in" on your PC. Or if you're using a receiver to get OTA (over the air) radio you can connect to you PC via the TosLink or HDMI etc. Otherwise use a radio feed from the web via a web browser or an app of your choosing.

2) Queue up for radio broadcast to test and make sure you're getting sound through your speakers



**Part Two:** *Only follow if you're using your PC for the radio broadcast AND the radio delay*

1) Download and install Virtual Audio Cable if you haven't done so already, then open it. 

2) Have the radio broadcast playing

3) In the taskbar, right-click the speaker icon (usually found on the bottom right on the taskbar) and click **Playback devices**

4) You will see a list of sound options, one of them being **Cable Input - VB - Audio Virtual Cable**. Select it and click **Set Default**. If this option is greyed out, right-click **Cable Input - VB - Audio Virtual Cable** and choose **Enable**.
	
	Sound will stop coming from your speakers. DON'T WORRY. This is part of the magic.

If you want listen to the intermission through the TV broadcast instead of the radio or when the game is done, just switch the audio input like you did in section 3 & 4 back to it's original settings. Follow section 3 & 4 again when intermission is done. 


**Part Three:**

1) Download and install Radio Delay if you haven't done so already, then open it.

2) Under **Input Device** choose **VB-Audio Virtual** from the drop-down menu. **Output** should be your speakers you'll be listening through.

3) Under **Delay in seconds** either use the slider, or use the input box to set the delay time to get it pefectly in sync with the video.

4) Hit the play button under **Control**

Holy Mackinaw! You now have the sweet dolcet tones of Bowen's call pumping through your speakers all in sync with the video feed.

MBL.tv, which also handles NHL.tv/Gamecenter, have a feature called "Audio Overlay" that allows the viewer to use a synced radio broadcast of their choice over the live video.

I encourage all who subscribe to Gamecenter/NHL.tv to let them know you want it. Then we dont have to don't to worry and fiddle with all these steps.
